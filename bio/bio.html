    Bassist and photographer Martin Masakowski was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. The son of a musical family, Martin's emersion in the arts began from a young age. He spent his youth studying visual arts and transitioned into music at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts high school. Martin went on to study jazz at the University of New Orleans before moving to The Netherlands to finish his bachelor’s in music at the Rotterdam Conservatory.  He spent the following years touring with an Eastern European folk band, the Balcony Players. With them he explored over 20 countries in Europe, performing in clubs and festivals and also visiting Roma gypsy villages to study their music and culture. As a result of his travels and the influence of his family and his city, Martin’s musical styles span across jazz, folk, classical, electronic, experimental, Eastern European and Indian genres. Martin is currently back home in New Orleans, performing regularly at clubs such as Snug Harbor and The Spotted Cat while also developing his skills as a graphic designer, photographer, and Tuvan throat singer!
